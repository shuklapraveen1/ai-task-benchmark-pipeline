## Why this is correct

The input state contains the selected implementation removed from its original function, while solution/ preserves the working repository implementation. Therefore the input-to-solution diff is the original implementation that restores the behavior required by the verifier.

## Validation

The task was accepted only after the strict verifier completed its required validation state machine. The machine-generated verification result is recorded below.

```json
{
  "deterministic_verified": true,
  "fail_before_verified": true,
  "pass_after_verified": true,
  "reasons": [],
  "validation_passed": true
}
